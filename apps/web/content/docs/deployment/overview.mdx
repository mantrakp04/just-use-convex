# Deployment Overview

Deploying a Convex application involves two separate deployments: the Convex backend and the frontend hosting.

## Architecture

   React App                 Database

```

## Deployment Components

### Convex Backend

Convex handles your backend automatically:

- **Functions**: Queries, mutations, and actions
- **Database**: Document storage with real-time sync
- **File Storage**: User uploads and media
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Background tasks and cron jobs

Deploy with a single command:

```bash
bunx convex deploy
```

### Frontend

Your React application is deployed to Cloudflare Workers with Alchemy.

## Deployment Environments

### Development

```bash
# Start local development
bun dev
```

This runs:
- Convex dev server (syncs functions in real-time)
- Frontend dev server (hot reload)

### Preview/Staging

For pull request previews, create a separate Convex project:

```bash
# Deploy to preview environment
bunx convex deploy --preview
```

### Production

Production deployments should be automated through CI/CD:

```bash
# Deploy backend
bunx convex deploy --prod

# Build and deploy frontend
bun run build
```

## One-Click Deploy

The fastest way to deploy is using Alchemy:

```bash
bunx alchemy deploy alchemy.run.ts
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Set all required environment variables (`VITE_CONVEX_URL`, `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL`, `VITE_SITE_URL`)
- [ ] Generate and set JWKS for auth token validation
- [ ] Configure `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` for CI/CD
- [ ] Configure authentication callback URLs
- [ ] Set up custom domain (if applicable)
- [ ] Enable rate limiting
- [ ] Configure CORS settings
- [ ] Test with production-like data
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts

## Cost Considerations

### Convex Pricing

Convex offers a generous free tier:

| Feature | Free Tier | Pro |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Function calls | 1M/month | Unlimited |
| Database | 1GB | 10GB+ |
| File storage | 1GB | Custom |
| Bandwidth | 1GB | Custom |

### Frontend Hosting

Most hosting providers offer free tiers suitable for small to medium applications:

- **Cloudflare Workers**: Usage-based with generous free tier
