# Frontend Hosting

Deploy your TanStack Start application to a hosting provider.

## Build the Application

First, build your application for production:

```bash
bun run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the output directory.

## Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel provides the best experience for TanStack Start applications.

### One-Click Deploy

Deploy directly to Vercel with pre-configured environment variables:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmantrakp04%2Fbetter-convex&env=VITE_SITE_URL,CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY,VITE_CONVEX_URL,VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL)

### Automatic Deployment

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import your repository at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Vercel auto-detects TanStack Start settings
4. Click "Deploy"

### Configuration

Create `vercel.json` for custom settings:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "bun run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".output",
  "framework": null
}
```

### Environment Variables

Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add your variables:
   - `VITE_CONVEX_URL` - Your Convex deployment URL
   - `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL` - Your Convex site URL
   - `VITE_SITE_URL` - Your production frontend URL
   - `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` - For automated deployments

### Custom Domain

1. Go to Project Settings → Domains
2. Add your domain
3. Configure DNS as instructed

## Netlify

### Deploy with Netlify CLI

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
bun add -g netlify-cli

# Login
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Configuration

Create `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build]
  command = "bun run build"
  publish = ".output/public"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

## Cloudflare Pages

### Deploy with Wrangler

```bash
# Install Wrangler
bun add -g wrangler

# Login
wrangler login

# Deploy
wrangler pages deploy .output/public
```

### Configuration

For SSR support, create `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
name = "my-app"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[site]
bucket = ".output/public"
```

## Docker Deployment

For custom infrastructure, use Docker:

```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:1 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json bun.lockb ./
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
RUN bun run build

FROM oven/bun:1-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/.output .output
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["bun", "run", ".output/server/index.mjs"]
```

Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

## Preview Deployments

### Vercel Preview

Vercel automatically creates preview deployments for pull requests. Configure preview environment variables separately from production.

### Manual Preview

Create a preview deployment manually:

```bash
# Vercel
vercel

# Netlify
netlify deploy
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Headers

Configure caching for static assets:

```typescript
// In your server configuration
app.use("/assets/*", (req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader("Cache-Control", "public, max-age=31536000, immutable");
  next();
});
```

### CDN Configuration

Most hosting providers include CDN by default. For custom setups:

1. Configure your CDN to cache static assets
2. Set appropriate TTLs (1 year for hashed assets)
3. Purge cache on deployment

### Bundle Analysis

Analyze your bundle size:

```bash
# Add to package.json scripts
"analyze": "bun run build && bunx source-map-explorer .output/**/*.js"
```

## Monitoring

### Error Tracking

Integrate error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket):

```typescript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
});
```

### Analytics

Add analytics (Plausible, Fathom, PostHog):

```typescript
// In your root layout
<script
  defer
  data-domain="yourdomain.com"
  src="https://plausible.io/js/script.js"
/>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

Check common issues:

```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules .output
bun install
bun run build
```

### Environment Variable Issues

Verify variables are set:

```bash
# Vercel
vercel env ls

# Netlify
netlify env:list
```

### CORS Issues

If seeing CORS errors, verify:
1. `BETTER_AUTH_URL` matches your production domain
2. Convex CORS settings allow your domain

## Next Steps

Configure [production environment variables](/docs/deployment/environment-variables) for your deployment.
