# Frontend Hosting

Deploy your TanStack Start application to Cloudflare Workers using Alchemy.

## Build the Application

First, build your application for production:

```bash
bun run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the output directory.

## Cloudflare Workers (Alchemy)

### Deploy

From the repo root:

```bash
bunx alchemy deploy alchemy.run.ts
```

### Environment Variables

Set these in your Alchemy environment:

- `VITE_CONVEX_URL` - Your Convex deployment URL
- `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL` - Your Convex site URL
- `VITE_SITE_URL` - Your production frontend URL
- `VITE_AGENT_URL` - Your agent worker URL

### Local Development

The Alchemy Vite plugin uses `apps/web/wrangler.json` for bindings.
Regenerate it whenever you update `alchemy.run.ts`:

```bash
bunx alchemy dev alchemy.run.ts
```
